<p>In 2011, one of the main reasons for the start of the revolution in Tunisia was the high unemployment rate. Particularly in center and southern regions of the country. One symptom amongst others of exacerbated social inequalities.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Mohamed Bouazizi, originally from Sidi-Bouzid, whose suicide fueled the uprising had to work as an ambulant vegetable merchant after dropping out of high school to support his family. </p>

<p> After constant exclusion from getting an official authorization, he got suspended which led to his suicide. </p>

<p> 3 years after the revolution, the disparities remained visible. </p>

<p> I built  <strong><a href="/cartedashboard.html"> the unemployment dashboard</a></strong>, solely using Rmarkdown and R visualization packages, it shows unemployment data from the 2014 general Tunisian census of the population. The general census of the population is executed every 10 years.<br>

<strong> Note </strong> : The interactive map shows the total unemployment rates in the country's delegations. </p>
